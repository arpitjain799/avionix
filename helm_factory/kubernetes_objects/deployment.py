        percentage of desired pods (ex: 10%). This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is \
        0. Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. Defaults to \

        immediately when the rolling update starts, such that the total number of old \
        and new pods do not exceed 130% of desired pods. Once old pods have been \
        killed, new ReplicaSet can be scaled up further, ensuring that total number of \

        down. This can not be 0 if MaxSurge is 0. Defaults to 25%. Example: when this \

        immediately when the rolling update starts. Once new pods are ready, old \
        ReplicaSet can be scaled down further, followed by scaling up the new \
        ReplicaSet, ensuring that the total number of pods available at all times \
        during the update is at least 70% of desired pods.
